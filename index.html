			A child asked his father, "How were people born?" So his father
			said, "Adam and Eve made babies, then their babies became adults and
			made babies, and so on." The child then went to his mother, asked
			her the same question and she told him, "We were monkeys then we
			evolved to become like we are now." The child ran back to his father
			and said, "You lied to me!" His father replied, "No, your mom was
			talking about her side of the family."
